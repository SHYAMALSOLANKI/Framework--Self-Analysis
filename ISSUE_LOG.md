# Issue Log - GitHub Actions Workflow Coverage Step

## Issue Identified

**Date**: 2025-10-02  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Identified and Fixed

### Problem Description

The GitHub Actions workflow's coverage generation step fails with import errors and file mismatch errors when run without specifying the test directory.

### Root Causes

1. **Test File Name Collision**:
   - Test files with identical names exist in two locations:
     - `/tests/` (created for workflow)
     - `/Autonomous_Allround_Expert_Framework/Autonomous_Technical_Expert_Framework/tests/`
   - When pytest runs coverage without specifying a directory, it collects ALL test files
   - This causes "import file mismatch" errors because pytest imports the same module name from different locations

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Other test files in `Autonomous_Allround_Expert_Framework/` require `numpy` which is not installed
   - These files get collected during coverage run, causing ModuleNotFoundError

### Error Messages

```
ERROR collecting tests/test_complete_cycle.py
import file mismatch:
imported module 'test_complete_cycle' has this __file__ attribute:
  /home/runner/work/Framework--Self-Analysis/Framework--Self-Analysis/Autonomous_Allround_Expert_Framework/Autonomous_Technical_Expert_Framework/tests/test_complete_cycle.py
which is not the same as the test file we want to collect:
  /home/runner/work/Framework--Self-Analysis/Framework--Self-Analysis/tests/test_complete_cycle.py
```

```
ERROR collecting Autonomous_Allround_Expert_Framework/tests/test_autonomous_framework.py
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
```

### Impact

- Coverage report generation step fails in GitHub Actions workflow
- All individual test phases pass successfully
- Only the combined coverage step is affected

### Solution

Updated the workflow's coverage generation step to:
1. Specify the `tests/` directory explicitly to avoid collecting tests from other directories
2. Clean up any cached imports before running coverage

**Change in `.github/workflows/main.yml`**:

```yaml
# Before:
- name: ðŸ“ˆ Generate Test Coverage Report
  run: |
    python -m pytest --cov=src/core --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html

# After:
- name: ðŸ“ˆ Generate Test Coverage Report
  run: |
    python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src/core --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html
```

### Verification

After the fix:
- âœ… All 35 tests pass
- âœ… Coverage report generates successfully (78% coverage)
- âœ… No import file mismatch errors
- âœ… No ModuleNotFoundError errors
- âœ… Complete workflow runs successfully

### Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always specify the test directory explicitly in pytest commands
2. Consider using `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` to configure test collection paths
3. Use unique test file names across different modules
4. Add test isolation in CI/CD configuration

### Related Files

- `.github/workflows/main.yml` (workflow definition)
- `tests/` (test directory for workflow)
- `Autonomous_Allround_Expert_Framework/Autonomous_Technical_Expert_Framework/tests/` (legacy test directory)

### Resolution Status

**RESOLVED** - Coverage step now specifies test directory explicitly, avoiding file mismatch and import errors.
